# Python Module 08 – Iterators

This module is part of a structured Python learning path focused on
writing clear, robust and explainable Python code.

The goal of this module is to understand Python’s iteration protocol
and build custom iterators with full control over iteration behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the iterator protocol (`__iter__` and `__next__`)
- Differentiate iterables, iterators and generators
- Build custom iterator classes
- Control iteration flow explicitly
- Explain how Python’s iteration mechanism works internally

---

## 🧠 Topics covered

- Iterables vs iterators
- Iterator protocol
- Custom iterator classes
- `__iter__` and `__next__`
- Advanced iteration patterns

---

## 🧪 Exercises overview

### Exercise 0 – Simple iterator  
**Focus:** Implementing the iterator protocol

### Exercise 1 – Stateful iterators  
**Focus:** Maintaining internal iteration state

### Exercise 2 – Iterator vs generator  
**Focus:** Comparing control and readability

### Exercise 3 – Custom iteration scenarios  
**Focus:** Designing iteration for real data flows

---

## 🧩 Design principles

- Explicit iteration logic over hidden behavior
- Predictable and explainable iteration flow
- Clear state management inside iterators
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Learning-oriented solutions aligned with the subject

---

## 🛠️ Technical constraints

- Python 3.10+
- flake8 compliant
- Standard library only
- Clear separation between logic and execution
- Use of `main()` when applicable

---

## 📌 Notes

Iterators expose how Python really works under the hood.
